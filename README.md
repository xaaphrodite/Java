# Java Language
      
   Java is a class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
It's a general-purpose programming language intended to let application developers write once, run anywhere (WORA), Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. 
The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. 
Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. 
As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. 
Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions.

Sun has defined and supports four editions of Java targeting different application environments and segmented many of its APIs so that they belong to one of the platforms. The platforms are:

- Java Card for `smart-cards`.
- Java Platform, Micro Edition `Java ME` – targeting environments with limited resources.
- Java Platform, Standard Edition `Java SE` – targeting workstation environments.
- Java Platform, Enterprise Edition `Java EE` – targeting large distributed enterprise or Internet environments.
   
## Example
```java
public class HelloWorld {
      public static void main(String[] args) {
      System.out.println("Hemllo World!"); // Prints the string to the console.
    }
}
```
